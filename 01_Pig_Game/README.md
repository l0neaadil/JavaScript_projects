## PIG Game:

GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND 
  score.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. 
  After that, it's the next player's turn.
- It is the global score which decides the winner not the round score.

- If the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- If two sixes come consecutively for the same player all his global as well as round score is lost.

- The first player to reach 100 points (default value) on GLOBAL score wins the game. However this game
 provides an option to set the winning score.
